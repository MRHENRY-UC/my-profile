                I am a highly motivated and results-driven individual.  I have had experience in data collation, management, leadership, project management and digital marketing. Proven ability to work in a fast-paced environment, with a track record of delivering projects on time. I joined Tech because of my love for tech and the ability to create something amazing from scratch. I love how smart developers think and I can’t help but be one….wink.
